##Design Work

<p class="resume-job-data">
	<span class="purple">Interaction Designer</span><br />
	<a href="http://kenshoo.com/">Kenshoo</a> (Chicago, IL)<br />
	June 2013 &mdash; Present<br />
</p>
- Responsible for marketing web materials & variety of internal tools
- Work closely with web developers to maintain Wordpress site
- Bigger projects include a complete overhaul of the corporate site design & development of site style guide
- Started as in-house graphic designer, promoted to interaction designer June 2014
- In-house graphic design projects included reports & white papers, brochures, infographics, office wall decals, and the occasional in-house branded sales competition soccer ball trophy

<p class="resume-job-data">
	<span class="purple">Lead Graphic Designer</span><br />
	The Portfolio Center, Columbia College Chicago (Chicago, IL)<br />
	January 2012 &mdash; May 2013<br />
</p>
- Responsibilites split between in-house graphic design & student designer
- In-house projects included style guide & templates for event posters, web graphics, branded promotional materials, and event branding identities
- Student designer role included sitting side-by-side with Columbia students in 1-hour design sessions, creating career development materials such as business cards, resum&eacute; layouts, press kits, logos, and personal site CSS edits (using Virb)
- Promoted to lead November 2013
>Biggest Takeaway: Trying to brand a complete stranger in a one-hour session while they watch over your shoulder is a very rewarding, albeit slightly insane, design exercise. If you want to force yourself to nimbly swim through hotkeys and render your ideas quickly, try doing a project with your client staring you down the entire time.

##Non-Design Work

<p class="resume-job-data">
	<span class="purple">Brand Ambassador Manager</span><br />
	<a href="http://www.periscope.com/">Periscope</a> (remote from Minneapolis, MN)<br />
	May 2012 &mdash; Semptember 2012<br />
</p>
- Hired and managed team of 60+ college students to run an after-hours shopping event for college freshman at a local Target
- Oversaw 1,500 college student attendants
- Managed social network marketing & event promotion prior to event
- Asked to return to maintain Facebook page post-event from September '12 &mdash; May '13
>Biggest takeaway: I really wanted to run a custom ad for the event in our school paper, so I pulled apart random, Periscope-provided PDFs and designed my own ad using their language and assets. Instead of dismissing me outright, their CD saw my ad and said, "Not bad for a hack job." I am still proud of this backhanded compliment. If you want to be a designer, ask people to let you design things.

<p class="resume-job-data">
	<span class="purple">Resident Assistant</span><br />
	<a href="http://www.periscope.com/">Residence Life, Columbia College Chicago</a> (Chicago, IL)<br />
	August 2010 &mdash; May 2012<br />
</p>
- Planned events and activities for college students
- Enforced building policies, provided a leadership role, and was a resource to ~56 students in a year in an urban residence hall
- Oversaw entire building for weekly, sometimes multiple, 12-hour overnight shifts
- Tried to convince many 18-year-olds to not participate in drugs or alcohol on campus
>Biggest Takeaway: The easiest way to make a large group of teenage strangers befriend each other is to force them to participate in eye-roll inducing activities. They complain together, and bond. Being the bad guy isn't always a bad thing.
