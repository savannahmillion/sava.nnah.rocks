I'm Savannah Million and this is my website!<br />

People sometimes ask me if "Million" is really my last name. It is. When I was a kid, we had a neighbor whose last name was "Ayer," and side-by-side our mailboxes read "Million Ayer." _Millionaire._ Over a decade later, and I'm still amused by this.<br />

I am primarily an interaction designer, amatuer front-end web developer, and hobbyist illustrator. My work history mostly consists of design, advertising, marketing, and event planning. I have a <a href="{{ homepage }}about/resume">resum&eacute;</a> here that goes into more detail.<br>

Below is a list of my various profiles across the internet. If you'd like to get in touch, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:sav@nnah.rocks">sav@nnah.rocks</a>.

##Some more about me:

I really enjoy video games, web comics, movies with fast-talking quippy dialogue, and discussing technology and the future. If I go for a long time without traveling, I get sad. I'm happiest when I'm experiencing new things.

##Here are some places that I have lived:
- Seattle, WA
- Menlo Park, CA
- Clarksville, AR
- Philadelphia, PA (but only for a summer)
- Chicago, IL, currently, with my cat <a href="#">Pye</a><br>

##Here are some Chicago events that I frequent:
- [Girl Develop It](http://www.girldevelopit.com/) classes
- [AIGA events](http://chicago.aiga.org/)
- Chicago Product Design meetups
- [Creative Mornings](http://creativemornings.com/cities/chi)
- [Puzzled Pint](http://www.puzzledpint.com/)

##A little bit about this site:
The site design was hand-coded entirely by me. I did almost all of the original design iteration in [SketchApp](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). The blog functionality is powered by [statamic](http://statamic.com/). I used [sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) mixins, and the bourbon [neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) framework. The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/savannahmillion/Personal-Site) if you want to take a closer look.
