project-description: Twelve holiday micro games released over twelve days.
---

For the twelve days of December leading up to Christmas, <a href="http://david-laskey.com/">David Laskey</a> and I made twelve micro games and released one each day. Each game has a theme based on the verse of the Christmas carol "Twelve Days of Christmas." You can view the games on <a href="http://12gamesofxmas.com/">12gamesofxmas.com</a>! David was responsible for all of the game development &amp; audio and I created all of the art and designed/built the website.

<p>Not all of the games are released yet, so I'll be updating this page with more screenshots and details in early 2015. Happy holidays everybody!</p>
