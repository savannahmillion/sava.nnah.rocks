##Pie! Pie! Pie!

Hi friends, I know you are probably all partied out or whatever (or will be) but my birthday is coming up and I would like to spend it with *you*. And a pie. Hopefully a few pies.

##When: Friday, January 2nd, 7pm
##Where: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Revolution+Brewing+Brewery/@41.9337057,-87.7061171,15z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1srevolution+brewery+tap+room!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x4d37501297f3020b">Revolution Brewery Tap Room</a> <p>(the one by Belmont blue line, not the restaurant)</p>

No need to RSVP. If you're around, come hang out and have a drink and eat pie with me. I will be bringing pie, but you are welcome to bring pie also, if you feel like it. I'm going to try to go to Bang Bang Pie (&hearts;!) but I may end up being lazy and just baking instead (if so, that will most assuredly NOT be as good as Bang Bang Pie).

Hope to see you there!

p.s. You are totally welcome to bring friends, of course.
