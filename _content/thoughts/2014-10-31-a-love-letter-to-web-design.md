I built this entire site in two days.

...but I started this project almost two years ago. Since then, I've designed it, built it, scrapped it, redesigned it, built part of it, scrapped most of it, designed it again, built it again, scrapped part of it again, so on and so forth, until I landed here, with this borderline gut-decision version of a personal site that is still unfinished and barely resembles its initial version. 

I suffer from constant dissatisfaction. I hate most of my creations, sometimes instantly after creating them. With every new project comes great enthusiasm, hand-in-hand with immense apprehension: I can't wait to have a new Thing, but I know that with all new Things, I'll have to work through my fear of knowing how much I'll despise it when it's done.

Professional projects have a deadline, and are easier to come to terms with "finished." Personal projects for me can be disastrous. When I am my own client, I am the WORST client. I change my mind constantly. I fail to set appropriate deadlines for myself. I go through phases of apathy and phases of demanding my idea come to fruition immediately after thinking it. I am my own nightmare.

As much of a nuisance as this trait sounds, I still like to look at the silver lining. Because of my unending resentment for my own work, I've found:
- My hatred for my personal status-quo pushes me to constantly learn new things and improve
- My biting apprehension and fear makes me challenge all of my decisions and never settle on my first idea
- My distaste for permanence has allowed me to realize how much _I fucking love the internet_

That last bullet is really important to me. I love print in the way that non-designers love print; there is something sweet about interacting with tactile pieces. But my affection for print pales in comparison to my affection for all things digital. Knowing that I have the ability to change my mind, drag all of my hard work into the trash can (or rm them in command line if I'm feeling tech-y, right guys?) and start fresh is such a relief. I could hate this entire site next week, or tomorrow, and if I do, that's okay, because I can just do it all over again.

Regardless of the pros, I hope to one day work through my hate and craft some things that I like. Maybe even things that I _love_. Until then, don't be surprised if you navigate to sava.nnah.rocks tomorrow, and it's redirected to indecisive-designer.io, bright orange, and chock full of CSS animations and photos of my cat. &#9813;
