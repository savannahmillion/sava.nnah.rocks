Thank you for taking the time to read my application! As there wasn't a good spot for this sentiment in the application questionaire, I wanted to take a moment and list out some things that drew me to 8th Light in particular:
- Your Leadership page has women on it! Multiple women!
- You've hosted Girl Develop It classes / meetups
- You do pair programming
- Your culture of learning isn't all talk; you actively encourage it
- You dedicate resources to creating open source software
- The color scheme on your website (I'm all about warm grays)

On my website you'll find a couple of my recent projects, but I have some in-progress work that I can't post publicly that I would love to show you in person.
